							<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>

<section>
								<h3>When and where will the interviews be held?</h3>
								<p>
                Final dates of the interviews are still to be determined but are expected to be held in the first week of April. Invitations to interview will be sent shortly and the interviews will be conducted via zoom.
								</p>
							</section>
							
							<section>
								<h3>Do I need a Masters degree?</h3>
								<p>
								An MSc in a related subject is desirable but not essential. Applicants with a good undergraduate degree in a relevant subject and strong evidence of research interests in ecology and/or data science will be competitive. 
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Do I need to decide now which of the 9 available projects to apply to?</h3>
								<p>
								No, applicants apply to the programme as a whole and will undertake rotation projects in their first year in their top 3 project choices. At the end of the first year, students will then choose their PhD project from one of their 3 rotation projects. However, you should state in your personal statement the project (or projects) you are most interested in.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>I am only interested in one of the projects. Am I guaranteed to be able to select this project?</h3>
								<p>
								We can't guarantee that you will be able to select your first choice project, but we will do our best to accommodate your preferences. If two students share the same first choice project, then it is possible for both to work with the same supervisor. However, sufficiently distinct research questions would have to be developed for each student and this would have to be agreed with the supervisor and the programme committee.
								If you are only interested in one project, you should state this in your personal statement.
								</p>
							</section>

							

							<section>
								<h3>How many places are available?</h3>
								<p>
								Each year there are 5 scholarships available and there will be 3 intakes over the course of the programme. There are also 3 Master's plus PhD Scholarships available over the course of the programme, meaning a total of 18 scholarships will be awarded.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Are the scholarships available to international applicants?</h3>
								<p>
								Yes, each year there are a limited number of scholarships available to international applicants. Out of the 15 PhD-only scholarships during the lifetime of the programme, 3 are available to international applicants and a further 3 are available to applicants from East African Community nations. 
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Will the Master's plus PhD scholarship provide a stipend?</h3>
								<p>
								Yes, in your first year you will undertake an MSc at the University of Glasgow and you will receive a maintenance award at UKRI base levels. The scholarship will also pay for your MSc tuition fees. At the end of year 1, you will enter the PhD programme as a first year PhD student.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Am I eligible for the Master's plus PhD Scholarships?</h3>
								<p>
								The Master's plus PhD Scholarships are available to Black students and those from a low-income household background. 
								To be eligible for the Master's plus PhD Scholarships, candidates must:
								<ul>
								<li>Be a UK domiciled student</li>
								<li>Not already have a Master’s degree from the host institution</li>
								<li>Meet one of the following criteria:</li>
								<ol>
								<li>Be from a low-income household background as evidenced by, for example, being in receipt of a full maintenance loan or Special Support loan during their undergraduate studies.</li>
								or
								<li>Be one of the following categories of ethnicity:</li>
								<ul>
								<li>Black African</li>
								<li>Black Caribbean</li>
								<li>Black Other</li>

								<li>Mixed – White and Black African</li>
								<li>Other mixed background (including Black African, Black Caribbean and Black Other)</li>
								</ul>
								</ol>
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Do I need to have programming skills in order to apply?</h3>
								<p>
								You will be given training in python and R programming so we do not expect applicants to be expert programmers. However, we would expect applicants to have some experience of programming and to be able to demonstrate enthusiasm for developing their coding skills.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>Will I be able to do field work?</h3>
								<p>
								Yes, many projects will involve some form of field work and you will be encouraged to engage in all aspects of the research process, from designing field experiments to collecting and analysing data.
								</p>
							</section>

							<section>
								<h3>What criteria will you use when selecting applicants?</h3>
								<p>
								As the programme is fundamentally oriented towards interdisciplinary research, our primary focus will be on identifying candidates who show a strong research potential and the ability to communicate well and work across discipline boundaries. Applicants can evidence their research capacity in different ways and they should emphasise in their personal statement the distinct expertise, initiative, and qualities that demonstrate their potential for postgraduate research.
